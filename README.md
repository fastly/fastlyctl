# FastlyCTL [![Gem Version](https://img.shields.io/gem/v/fastlyctl.svg)](https://rubygems.org/gems/fastlyctl)

**DEPRECATED**: Please use [`fastly/cli`](https://github.com/fastly/cli) instead.

---

A CLI for managing Fastly configurations with [Fastly's API](https://docs.fastly.com/api/config).

## Dependencies

 * Ruby 2.2+
 * [diffy](https://rubygems.org/gems/diffy)
 * [launchy](https://rubygems.org/gems/launchy)
 * [thor](https://rubygems.org/gems/thor)
 * [typhoeus](https://rubygems.org/gems/typhoeus)

## Installation

```
gem install fastlyctl
```

## Workflow

Basic setup for a service:

```
$ fastlyctl download --service 72rdJo8ipqaHRFYnn12G2q
No VCLs on this service, however a folder has been created. Create VCLs in this folder and upload.
$ cd Sandbox\ -\ 72rdJo8ipqaHRFYnn12G2q/
$ fastlyctl skeleton
Boilerplate written to main.vcl.
$ fastlyctl upload
VCL main does not currently exist on the service, would you like to create it? y
[You will see a diff here for the new VCL]
Given the above diff, are you sure you want to upload your changes? y
main uploaded to 72rdJo8ipqaHRFYnn12G2q
VCL(s) have been uploaded to version 286 and validated.
$ fastlyctl activate
Version 286 on 72rdJo8ipqaHRFYnn12G2q activated.
```

Once you are past this point you can edit your VCLs and use the commmand `fastlyctl upload && fastlyctl activate`. The service ID will be automatically inferred from the folder you are currently in. In fact, all commands will attempt to assume the service ID of the current directory if it is relevant.

You may find it useful to keep a Github repo with one folder created by this command for each service. This way you can version your VCL files.

## Command Reference

  * If you specify both versions, they will be diffed with each other.
 * If you provide service 1 but not service 2, service 2 will be assumed from the current working directory.
 * Regardless of how you specify services, if service 1 and service 2 are _different_, the versions will default to the active versions instead of local VCL.

```


### login

Login to the Fastly app and create an API token. This token will be stored in your home directory for the CLI to use for all requests.

If your origanization uses SSO to login to Fastly, this command will prompt you to create a token and save it to `~/.fastlyctl_token` on your computer. You may also create the token and save it to the fastlyctl_token file without using the `fastlyctl login` command at all.

Usage:

```
fastlyctl login
```

```
fastlyctl open [hostname]
